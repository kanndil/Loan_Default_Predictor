# Framework

for the website I used streamlite that is a python library and can be installed as follows:

    pip3 install streamlit
    
if an error appeared:
make sure to have :  7.0 <= click version  < 8.1 

# How to run the project

    cd /src
    streamlit run web_app.py

# URL of the hosted web application

just by running the file, the URL will appear in the terminal
